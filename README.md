# Malaria_Detection_CNN

Using the malaria dataset from tensorflow datasets. Using Convolutional Neural Networks to train a model for binary classification.

Dataset consists with images of blood samples through which we predict the uninfected and parasitized blood samples.

## 1. Model is built using Sequential API
## 2. Model is going to be built with the functional API
